- I spent an hour plus this afternoon trying to get OpenClaw to work with GPT. 

I asked it to do a simple task to send me a weekly stats recap email that Opus had no trouble with. 

Here's how the conversation went:

"You completely messed up the previous template"

"Sigh you made a mess. Why don’t you open the email template and I can edit manually"

"no you totally screwed it up tbh. let's switch the model to sonnet"

Again, big fan of OpenClaw (+ Codex) but this model simply doesn't seem to work with following through on agentic tasks (or just simple cron jobs).

Maybe it's a skill issue on my part - although the AI builder groups I'm part of say similar things.

Hopefully, Spud / GPT 5.5 will solve this.

- I switched my openclaw to gpt finally and it’s…not going to well.

Any tips to optimize it for this model? https://t.co/eKvtNUunc9

### Nan Yu (head of product @linear)

- If a press release comes out from each of the major labs, which one do you feel would have the shortest distance between what they said and what they believe?
  https://x.com/thenanyu/status/2045910980597530836
- I’ve always felt this as well, but I couldn’t put it to words until I read this. 

It’s like asking “should I get a red Lambo or a green Lambo?” expecting the correct answer to be “you shouldn’t buy a Lambo because that’s a poor financial decision.” https://t.co/LZVOnNZ47Y

### Guillermo Rauch (@vercel CEO)

- Here's my update to the broader community about the ongoing incident investigation. I want to give you the rundown of the situation directly.

A Vercel employee got compromised via the breach of an AI platform customer called https://t.co/7PY6gGtzgI that he was using. The details are being fully investigated.

Through a series of maneuvers that escalated from our colleague’s compromised Vercel Google Workspace account, the attacker got further access to Vercel environments.

Vercel stores all customer environment variables fully encrypted at rest. We have numerous defense-in-depth mechanisms to protect core systems and customer data. We do have a capability however to designate environment variables as “non-sensitive”. Unfortunately, the attacker got further access through their enumeration.

We believe the attacking group to be highly sophisticated and, I strongly suspect, significantly accelerated by AI. They moved with surprising velocity and in-depth understanding of Vercel.

At the moment, we believe the number of customers with security impact to be quite limited. We’ve reached out with utmost priority to the ones we have concerns about. All of our focus right now is on investigation, communication to customers, enhancement of security measures, and sanitization of our environments. We’ve deployed extensive protection measures and monitoring. We’ve analyzed our supply chain, ensuring Next.js, Turbopack, and our many open source projects remain safe for our community.

The recommendation for all Vercel customers is to follow the Security Bulletin closely (https://t.co/BLVnic9fJC). My advice to everyone is to follow the best practices of security response: secret rotation, monitoring access to your Vercel environments and linked services, and ensuring the proper use of the sensitive env variables feature.

In response to this, and to aid in the improvement of all of our customers’ security postures, we’ve already rolled out new capabilities in the dashboard, including an overview page of environment variables, and a better user interface for sensitive env var creation and management. As always, I’m totally open to your feedback.

We’re working with elite cybersecurity firms, industry peers, and law enforcement. We’ve reached out to Context to assist in understanding the full scale of the incident, in an effort to protect other organizations and the broader internet. I also want to thank the Google Mandiant team for their active engagement and assistance.

It’s my mission to turn this attack into the most formidable security response imaginable. It’s always been a top priority for me. Vercel employs some of the most dedicated security researchers and security-minded engineers in the world. I commit to keeping you updated and rolling out extensive improvements and defenses so you, our customers and community, can have the peace of mind that Vercel always has your back.

### Aaron Levie (ceo @box - your business lives in content. unleash it with AI)

- What gets missed with AI productivity gains is that by and large, most roles will continue to be as sophisticated as the tools allow. 

This is why also thinking through “today’s jobs will be replaced with AI” is a fallacy. Everyone thinks the market is static, but it’s not.

As a result of everyone having access to the same technology which augments our work, then users of the tools will increasingly raise their level of output to the point where the prior definition of the job is no longer relevant. Thus, those that understand their particular field and grow in their skills will continue to be differentiated vs. others.

If you can do far more, then you start to tackle bigger and harder problems. If you do that, then the expertise still is required to get the job done fully. 

The engineer with AI is going to be far more productive and capable with AI than the non-engineer trying to build the same piece of software. Building a lightweight app is no longer the definition of getting by in software development. Reviewing a contract will no longer be the definition of a paralegal. Splicing a video won’t be the definition of a video editor. Providing basic financial research won’t be the job of the financial analyst in the future.

Simply put, AI will naturally cause most roles to actually grow in complexity rather than reduce in complexity, because we can do far more with the tools.

### Garry Tan (President & CEO @ycombinator —Founder @garryslist—Creator of GStack & GBrain—designer/engineer who helps founders—SF Dem accelerating the boom loop)

- GStack works great inside your OpenClaw/Hermes... and where it was designed to be used, inside Claude Code too.

https://t.co/VPvWDzV5c0
  https://x.com/garrytan/status/2046097200292511968
- When I run across needs inside my OpenClaw or in my regular usage, I just have Claude Code make it, and then I release it open source

This is GStack v1.4 - with a new /make-pdf skill 

It works great with OpenClaw/Hermes as a tool. https://t.co/XgPejzWpoS
  https://x.com/garrytan/status/2046097059057651941
- You've got to tell your OpenClaw to implement it to replace crons and subgents to the extent it can. That's the best hack I am using myself for now, but hopefully can get this fixed with better plugin APIs soon

- Yes VCs should do more due diligence but first software went serverless and now it’s becoming headless so there’s not much left to look at, really

### Zara Zhang (Builder. Dangerously skips permissions. Harvard’17. GitHub: https://t.co/KCuEajezlL YouTube: https://t.co/8xzbGWtf6w)

- As AI gets more capable, product teams should spend more time on external communication (talking to users, customers, etc) than internal communication

1. Figuring out “what” to build will be a lot more important than building it. Getting this right requires sparks of inspiration that strike when you talk to external people, esp those who are every different from you. Since AI is very good at implementing solutions, humans should focus on understanding the PROBLEM

2. Teams will be a lot smaller, so internal communication overhead will decrease dramatically. Teams that work extensively with agents are already seeing a huge decrease in the number of internal meetings & coordination work 

3. I’m seeing a more dramatic version of this with some of my indie entrepreneur friends: they spend all day talking to customers, and then just dump the recordings at their agents who will figure out what to do and handle the execution

### Nikunj Kothari (partner @fpvventures - investing in seed/A. previous: early hire @meter, @opendoor, @atlassian & others. love @shimoleejhaveri + 👦👧)

- Cybersecurity companies are going to be worth a lot.. the pace of attacks is only going to increase as model capabilities improve. 

Humans will continue to be the primary vector of attack - and we haven’t seen anything yet.

Hugops to all the infra providers 🫡
